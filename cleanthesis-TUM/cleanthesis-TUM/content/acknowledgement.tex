As this thesis borders between computer science and qualitative research on consumer behaviour I would like PD Dr. Georg Groh of the Research Group for Social Computing for his input during the project and Hannah Danner from the Chair of Marketing and Consumer behavior. Without their collaboration this project and thesis would not be possible. 

Special thanks got to my supervisor Dietrich Trautmann for his support and good ideas during the project and for the continuous reviews and feedback while I wrote this thesis. 

Furthermore, I would like to thank the other team members of the SocialROM project Adnan Akhundov, Ahmed Ayad, Tim Berger, Rajat Jain, Tim Berger, Vishesh Mathur and Adrian Philipp for often tedious but every-time fruitful discussions every week.

While writing this thesis the English Writing Center of the TUM was contacted several times. I especially like to thank the fellows Rose Jacobs,  Sean Rohringer, Hasan Ashraf, and Keefe Huang for reviewing my thesis.

I would like to use this opportunity to thank my parents Irina and Alexander as well as my brother Julian for their continued support during the first part of my studies. Further, I would like to thank Maria Potzner for her support while working on this project and for proof-reading this thesis.
