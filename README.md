studied when the number of topics increases. Both approaches shall help domain
experts using topic modeling for their work and understand which effect a higher
or low number of topics has on the quality of the generated topics. To evaluate
the results multiple datasets of online discussions regarding organic products are
analyzed.

For the implementation Python and different libraries such as Scikit-learn, Genism and Pandas were used.
